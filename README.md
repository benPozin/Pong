## Overview
This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using Java and Swing. The game features two paddles and a ball, replicating the traditional Pong gameplay. Players can control the paddles to bounce the ball back and forth, aiming to score against the opponent by getting the ball past their paddle.
